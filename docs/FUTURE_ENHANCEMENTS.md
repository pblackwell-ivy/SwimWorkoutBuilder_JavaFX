# Future Enhancements (Prioritized)

1. Drag-and-drop reordering of SetGroups and SwimSets
2. Laps-based meters/yards conversions and smarter display rules
3. Dialog UX improvements (presets, validation, keyboard shortcuts)
4. Performance tuning: virtualization for long lists, caching of interval formats
5. Export/Print views (PDF/HTML) with compact workout summary
6. Theming API: easy swapping between `styles-ocean-depth.css` and others
7. Unit tests for LocalStore and interval formatting logic
